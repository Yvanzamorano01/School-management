# School Management System – System Explanation Prompt

## PURPOSE OF THIS PROMPT
You are working on an existing **School Management System (SMS)**.
This prompt explains **what the system is made of**, **how each module works**, and **how each page should behave**.

Your task is NOT to redesign the system randomly.
Your task is to **understand the domain, the rules, and the responsibilities of each module/page** before modifying or extending anything.

This is a **Single School Management System** (one school only).
The architecture must remain clean and ready for a future multi-school extension.

- students
